I've implemented the drag-and-drop between adapters feature. I need some time to put it on Github. This repo is not ready. So don't download it yet. 

And it is based on the DragSortAdapter by vinc3m1(https://github.com/vinc3m1/DragSortAdapter). I've fixed the weird scrolling bug and created a pull request to original DragSortAdapter branch.
